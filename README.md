# Lightning Talk: Stryker

This is a quick talk to demo mutation testing in C# using [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/).

## Agenda

* Overly simplified AWS S3 copy class library
    * Copies to a "normal" bucket if file is new, or a "glacier" bucket if old
* Code has 100% coverage - so it must be good, right?
